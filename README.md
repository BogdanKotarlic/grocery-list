## Getting Started

Grocery list
In this test task, we want to check the basic frontend skills of our
candidates. You must create an app allowing users to make their
grocery lists.
Here are user stories that should be covered:
• As a user, I can view my grocery list
• As a user, I can add, edit and delete new items to my grocery list
• As a user, I can add an amount to each item in the list
• As a user, I can mark an item as bought. This will cross out the title
and mark the checkbox as checked.
Technical requirements:
• For this task, we want to use NextJS as a framework
• Layouts are not specified, but the website should look good on
desktop and mobile
• Please use JSON-server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonserver) and React query (https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/
react/quick-start) to mock an API integration
• Push your code to the git repo and share a link with the finished
project
Not required, but it will be a benefit:
• MUI usage to build layouts
• Any additional functionality
• Server-side rendering examples
• Simple NodeJS server instead of JSON-server

## How to run the application?

Please run server first with node server.js command, and then run application with npm run dev command.
